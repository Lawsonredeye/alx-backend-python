# Python Annotations

Python is a static Dynamic typed language and this can be checked using type annotations and external libraries to check

One of the easiest ways of checking is using the typing module and declaring a variable, specifying what type of data it would store and also you can decide not to initialize it till you call it.

## How to declare Python Types
1. import the typing library: `from typing import List`
2. create an object using the following syntax : `number: int = 5` || `arr: List[string] = ["TravisMedia", "CodeWithLaw"]`
3. test using mypy
